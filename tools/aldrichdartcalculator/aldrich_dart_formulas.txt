Neck Dart Calculation (Method One)
Bust 88cm = 7cm Dart

For bust less than 88cm
Formula = (88 - Bust) / 4, * 0.6, - 7

For bust greater than 88cm up to 104cm
Formula = (Bust - 88) / 4, * 0.6, + 7

For bust between 104cm and 110cm
Formula = (110 - Bust) / 6, * 0.6, - 10

Bust 110cm = 10cm Dart

For bust greater than 110cm
Formula = (Bust - 110) / 6, * 0.6, + 10

Neck Dart Calculation – simpler but not the same as the book's and fails for bigger sizes (Method Two)
x = Bust - Chest - Back Width
Neck Dart = x/3

Waist Dart Calculation
Waist Difference = (Bust + Ease) - (Waist + Ease)
x = Waist Difference - 6 (+1cm for the Front Side Waist Dart, +3cm for the Front Waist Dart, +2cm for the Back Waist Dart)
x/4 (for 4 darts) = D

Waist Dart Distribution
Back Side Waist Dart = D
Front Side Waist Dart = D + 1
Back Waist Dart = D + 2
Front Waist Dart = D + 3

Reduced Darting
Waist Difference = (Bust + Ease) - (Waist + Ease)
x = (0.75% * Waist Difference) - 5 (+1cm for the Front Side Waist Dart, +1.5cm for the Back Waist Dart, +2.5cm for the Front Waist Dart)
x/4 (for 4 darts) = D

Waist Dart Distribution
Back Side Waist Dart = D
Front Side Waist Dart = D + 1
Back Waist Dart = D + 1.5
Front Waist Dart = D + 2.5
